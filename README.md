I have used the R software to do my analysis.

The number of people who are using the P2P network to download LARGE amounts of data(over 190,000 units) is about 146,066 ,
there are about 30286 MEDIUM(between 160,000-190,000) data users and about 358,602 users,LOW data users,
who download less than 160,000 units of data.

Conclusion: There is quite a big variation in the amount of data people are downloading through 
the P2P network. Few people download large amounts of data through the p2p network.


The number of people who are using the CDN network to download LARGE amounts of data(over 200,000 units) is about 189,904 ,
there are about 164,687 MEDIUM(between 100,000-200,000) data uers and about 180,362 users,LOW data users,
who download less than 100,000 units of data.

Conclusion: The distribution of the amount of download of data through the CDN network is quite even.


Analysis of users NOT connected to the backend network.
There are about 49,201 users who are not connected to the back end, also not connected to the P2P network.
There are about 25838 users who download LARGE amounts of data through the CDN network(over 200,000 units), 
about 16494 users who download MEDIUM amounts of data and about 6869 users who download LESS data.

Conclusion: Few people,who are not connected to the back end network as well as the P2P network, download large 
amounts of data through the CDN network .


After grouping the data by the different ISPs, I found that Arange users use the P2P network for downloading 
only 1.25% of their total download needs and the rest 98.75% through CDN servers.
For, BTP the distribution is quite even, about 45% of the content downloaded is through P2P and the rest 55% is through CDN servers.
Datch Telecom users use only do 1% of their downloading through P2P, the rest 99% through CDN.
For Fro Telecom, the number is about 2%(P2P), 98% through CDN servers.
Finally, Olga users download using P2P for only 1.2% of their total download needs and about 98.8% times through CDN servers.

Conclusion: Only BTP users are using the P2P network and the CDN servers quite evenly.



After grouping the data by the different STREAMs, 
I found that Streams 1,2,9 and 10 are using the P2P network well with 57%, 56%, 45% and 61% usages respectively.
The others are using the CDN network more than desired.


Suggestion:

While grouping the data by ISPs, meaningful inferences can be drawn.
Depending on the cost of moving the traffic from CDN network to P2P network, it is beneficial to look for 
solutions to channel the data of the ISPs(except for BTP)from CDN to P2P.

Also, maybe if I had access to the user interaction data of different ISPs, I could use it as a case 
study to do a bit more analysis on how/why BTP is different from the other ISPs.
